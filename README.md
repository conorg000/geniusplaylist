Trying to recreate my old iPod's 'Genius Playlist' feature

Goal: I miss my old iPod's 'Genius' playlist. You'd choose a song in your library, and it would make a 20-25 track playlist, containing other similar songs you own. Spotify's Radio option is sort of similar, but I want the playlist to contain only my saved (and usually downloaded) songs.
Maybe I'm trying to reverse-engineer Spotify's radio algorithm, and just apply it to my own songs. Yeah, that sounds right.

Steps:
- see what the Spotify API can actually provide: from memory, it doesn't give you very juicy data, just information on individual songs.
- find some examples of good Spotify radios, explore the data
